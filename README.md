# TOP-rockpaperscissors
This web app (rock-paper-scissors game) was developed to comply for one of the mini-projects in the javascript lessons of The Odin Project's foundations course. The following skills were practiced after continuing to learn in the course so far:

* Implement DOM manipulation techniques to dynamically add elements and event listeners for the functionality.
* Apply the git branching and merging practices thought in the course.
* Review the css styling techniques to achieve the expected layout of the page.

The icons used in the page were free and can be downloaded from https://www.svgrepo.com/.
